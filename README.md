# Project3
For this project what i did was an amalgamation of two react tutorial projects i have studied for react. 
First is a tic-tac-toe game which was taught in class but i converted to function using hooks, the second was a Movie Form where we learned to create a list, edit a list and delete a list. All from Ui to the DB.
